# Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator

The [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://botframework.com) is a service and [SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder) that enables organizations to build and deploy intelligent agents, known as bots.

The Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.
